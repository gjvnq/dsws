                <p> This extension, along with the command-line (CLI) tool, is designed to allow users to share and use pages focused on closed project documentation without hosting a website or using a server.
                    <br><br>
                    To install the CLI tool, go to the dsws-cli directory and use:
                    <br><br>
                    go build
                    <br><br>
                    To create the file with the pages, use the CLI tool to compress and build the DSWS file from any static site directory with native URLs, using the following command:
                    <br><br>
                    ./dsws pack [Directory_Path] [DSWS File Name]
                    <br><br>
                    For additional information about the cli tool, use:
                    <br><br>
                    ./dsws help
                    <br><br>
                    After creating the file, you can share it with the ones that need access. 
                    <br><br>
                    To view the pages, load the DSWS file into the designated area on the home page. After that, the page can be used normally, as if it were opened directly in the browser.</p>
