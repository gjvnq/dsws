                        This project is designed to allow users to pack, unpack, display and share pages 
                        focused on closed project documentation without hosting a website or using a server.</br>

                        The Project has two parts, a command-line (CLI) tool that can be found in our github bellow, and this extension, 
                        whose purpose is to unpack and display the static websites that would be in the ".dsws" 
                        file. After creating the file, you can share it with the ones that need access.To view the pages, 
                        load the DSWS file into the designated area on the home page. After that, the page can be used 
                        normally, as if it were opened directly in the browser.</br>
